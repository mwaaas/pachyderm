Provenance
==========

We haven't had time to write full documentation on Provenance yet. It's an important feature and these docs are coming soon, we promise!

For now, our `recent blog post on Provenance <https://medium.com/pachyderm-data/provenance-the-missing-feature-for-good-data-science-now-in-pachyderm-1-1-2bd9d376a7eb#.utvphjpt6>`_ will give you a good overview. 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask us `on Slack <http://slack.pachyderm.io>`_, or email us at `support@pachyderm.io <mailto:support@pachyderm.io>`_ and we'd be happy to help!

.. Understanding Where Your Data Came From
.. ---------------------------------------

.. Explain provenance -- across commits / across repos

.. inspect repo --> shows provenance
.. inspect commit

.. list-repo -p data would return filter and Sum. 

.. commits looks weird -- call inspect commit and follow prov trail -- great for debugging for audit trail...
