## ./pachctl pipeline

Docs for pipelines.

### Synopsis


Pipelines are a powerful abstraction for automating jobs.

Pipelines take a set of repos as inputs, rather than the set of commits that
jobs take. Pipelines then subscribe to commits on those repos and launches a job
to process each incoming commit.
Creating a pipeline will also create a repo of the same name.
All jobs created by a pipeline will create commits in the pipeline's repo.


```
./pachctl pipeline
